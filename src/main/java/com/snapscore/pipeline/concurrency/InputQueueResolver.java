 * Defines the "grouping" of inputs that are to be processed so that all inputs that go into one group/queue
 * are processed in the same order in which they arrived in that group/queue.
 *
 * Example:
 * When we want to process match data in parallel but also preserve the order for individual matches
 * we create an implementation of this base class that will take the matchId as the grouping key
 * so that all data for a single match gets processed in the order in which it was submitted for processing
